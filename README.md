Node.js V8 native fs, enhanced with util.promisify and standard extra methods. Written in full ES2017, sans every sync method. *Async is the future!*

Testing phase...

Docs
------

All FS Native methods which return a callback, return a promise instead. All `fs-extra` methods return a promise exclusivly. No sync methods are included from either FS Native or fs-extra. Requires minimum Node.js v8.0.0.

Credit
------

`fs-nextra` is heavily based on `fs-extra`, this module wouldn't be possible without it's author:
